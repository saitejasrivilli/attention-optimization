## ALTERNATIVE REPOSITORY NAMES

### If you want something shorter:
- `attention-bench` - Shorter, still clear
- `flash-attention-benchmark` - Very specific
- `attn-optimizer` - Catchy abbreviation
- `transformer-attention-suite` - More descriptive

### If you want something catchier:
- `attention-turbo` - Modern, energetic
- `gpu-attention-optimizer` - Highlights GPU focus
- `llm-inference-optimization` - Broader scope
- `inference-benchmark-suite` - General applicability
